# Super-Chunks
## Description
A game about a chunk of meat who fights off evil veggies. A remake/sequel to the much worse game here: chunksgame.webs.com.

## Story
The evil King Veggie has taken over the world. You are Chunks, a chunk of meat who has set out to protect the fleshy people of your world, and destroy all the Vegetables that stand in your way. You'll run, jump, and climb all the way to King Veggie and do whatever it takes to save the day.
