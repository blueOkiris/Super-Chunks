Tips for Good Water Level:
- Part water, part platforming
- Don't throw out old mechanics
	* Specifically don't take control from player
- B/c secret is double jump, focus on that
	* To avoid linearity, don't make it exclusive
	* Try to suggest it
- Pipes/Tunnels/Enclosing can help to make interesting


(Btw I use nano :P)
